## Backstory

Never underestimate the raw power of the ant. As E. O. Wilson says, "Ants have the most complicated social organization on earth next to humans.". To understand the world we must first understand the power of the ant. Our story begins with an ant named "Toasty" who while known for making trouble was also known for being extremely curious and inteligent. Toasty paved the path for all human civilization in the year of 200,000 BCE. Toasty had humble beginings as all ants do. Toasty grew up in the land of "Antallia" and had a rise of political power due to his strong interlinked connection with the people of Antallia. Toasty ended up having a many children who now search for food similarly to how Toasty did back in his days before politics. 

## Versions

Our simulation of these ants have come in various different versions. Let's walk through some of our key releases of our program!

## Version 0.1
- Draws Ant(s) to screen
- Ants move in random directions

## Version 0.2
- Create Food and Base (anthill)
- Added interactivity of Ants to the aforementioned

## Version 0.3
- Fixed detection for Ants within Base and Food
- New Food spawns after previous one is depleted
- Added Food and Base Counters
- Ants teleport to the other side of the screen if it goes out of bounds (Infinite Ground Effect)

## Version 1.0
- Added a life cycle
- Food now regenerates based on a set timer
- Population counter is found at the top-left of the screen

## Version 1.1
- Fixed Food spawning out of bounds

## Version 1.2
- Fixed Ants generating Food when no Food is present
- Ants with Food return to Base

## Contributing

If you would like to add some code to the simulation to donate to the cause of Toasty and his children... Fear not as you can harnest the power of GitHub to improve the livelyhood of Toasty's children searching for food day and night...
